    <h2>Theoretical Computer Science</h2>
    <p> In the theory of computation area, we use mathematical
      techniques to understand the nature of computation and to
      design and analyze algorithms for important and fundamental
      problems. 
    </p>
    <p> The members of the theory group are all interested, in
      one way or another, in the limitations of computation:
      What problems are not feasible to solve on a computer? How
      can the infeasibility of a problem be used to rigorously
      construct secure cryptographic protocols? What problems
      cannot be solved faster using more machines? What are the
      limits to how fast a particular problem can be solved or
      how much space is needed to solve it? How do randomness,
      parallelism, the operations that are allowed, and the need
      for fault tolerance or security affect this?  Here are
      some of the research areas of current interest: 
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithmic Game Theory/Mechanism Design</h3>
    <p>
      Game theory and mechanism design study processes in which self
      interested agents participate so as to maximize their desired
      utility (e.g. their value for items obtained minus the price
      paid for those items). Such self-interested behaviour may not
      align with more global objectives (e.g. the revenue of the
      seller or the total valuation of all items allocated). Game
      theory and mechanism design are well established fields within
      Economics. More recently, algorithmic considerations have
      shown that many of the beautiful results within this
      established field have to be re-thought due to computational
      limitations. 
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      Algorithm design and analysis is an essential aspect of
      every area of computer science. Over the past decade, the
      <i>big data</i> phenomenon has brought into sharp focus the
      design of fast algorithms. Our group focuses on the the
      design of efficient (optimal or approximation) algorithms
      for classic TCS problems such as maximum flow, and for novel
      problems arising from machine learning, statistics, and
      differential privacy. Such algorithm design brings together
      techniques from a huge number of diverse areas such as
      combinatorics, high-dimensional geometry, continuous
      optimization, approximation theory, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Complexity Theory</h3>
    <p> 
      Motivated by questions such as the P vs NP problem, the goal 
	  of complexity theory is to find the limits of efficient 
	  computation. Which problems are inherently hard to solve, 
	  and what makes them so? How do resource constraints (such as
	  limited time and memory) inhibit algorithms, and why? And 
	  which mathematical and algorithmic tools can we use to study 
	  these questions?
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Research in this area interacts broadly with other areas in 
	  theoretical computer science and in mathematics, and integrates 
	  various focal points of interest. Among these focal points are 
	  lower bounds for circuits and for Turing machines, proof 
	  complexity, algebraic and arithmetic computation, 
	  pseudorandomness and derandomization, error-correcting codes, 
	  interactive protocols, circuit-analysis algorithms, and more.
    </p>

    <h3>Cryptography</h3>
    <p>
      Traditionally, cryptography concerned the question of how two
      people who share a key can securely communicate over an
      insecure channel. This question is related to the existence of
      pseudo-random generators and one-way functions, and involves
      deep open questions in computational complexity. Public-key
      encryption and signatures allow us to do even more things.
      Recently, we have considered fine-grained questions about ways
      in which information can remain secret, leading to
      applications such as secure and efficient computing using an
      insecure "cloud".
    </p>

    <h3>Differential Privacy</h3>
    <p>
      Differential privacy is an area of research which
      formalizes private data analysis, analogously to how
      cryptography formalizes secure communication. Machine
      learning and statistics are increasingly applied to data
      sets which contain sensitive information about people. A
      slew of attacks has shown that it is possible to link
      seemingly aggregate statistics of such data sets with
      publicly available data and reveal private information
      about specific individuals. The central goal of
      differential privacy is to design algorithms that 
      make such attacks provably impossible while extracting
      useful aggregate information from the data. Our focus is
      on designing efficient differentially private algorithms
      for problems in statistics and machine learning, and to
      understand the inherent limitations of private data
      analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Discrete Mathematics</h3>
    <p> 
      Discrete Mathematics involves the study of the
      properties, algorithms and applications of mathematical
      structures built on discrete objects. There is a rich interplay
       between theoretical computer science and
      discrete mathematics: structural results about discrete
      objects often underlie algorithmic advances, while an
      algorithmic viewpoint can lead to a deeper understanding
      of the mathematics. Our group is primarily concerned with
      the mathematical and algorithmic issues pertaining to
      Graph Theory and Discrepancy Theory.
    </p>

    <h3>Discrepancy Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Discrepancy theory studies how well discrete objects can
      approximate continuous ones: how uniform can a set of n
      points in the plane be? How balanced can a hypergraph
      coloring be? Such questions have many connections to
      computer science, from proving data structure lower
      bounds, to designing efficient approximation
      algorithms. Our group is interested in these connections,
      and in algorithmic problems in discrepancy theory.
    </p>

    <h3>Graph Theory</h3>
    <p>
      A graph consists of V (a set of vertices) and E (a set of
      edges, either ordered or unordered, joining pairs of
      vertices in V). It is clear that any binary relation may be
      modeled as a graph; thus, applications of graphs pervade
      computer science. The interests of our group include
      computational biology, random structures and the structure
      of electrical circuits, as well as more traditional graph
      theory such as graph colouring, perfect graphs,
      hamiltonicity and generalizations of graphs. 
    </p>

    <!-- <h3>Combinatorial Designs</h3> -->
    <!-- <p> A combinatorial design is a collection of sets satisfying -->
    <!--   some given regularity properties of its subsets. The -->
    <!--   structures can be as loose as regular graphs or as tight as -->
    <!--   finite projective geometries. The fundamental problems of -->
    <!--   design theory are the existence, enumeration and generation -->
    <!--   of designs with given parameters. Applications of designs -->
    <!--   are found in statistics (the design of experiments), -->
    <!--   error-correcting codes, computer architecture and -->
    <!--   cryptography. Our group's interests include the development -->
    <!--   and analysis of deterministic and randomized combinatorial -->
    <!--   search techniques, algebraic methods for the construction of -->
    <!--   solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, sub-object -->
    <!--   and/or automorphism-free systems, systems containing -->
    <!--   specified small partial systems and design invariants. </p> -->

    <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
    <p>
      Quantum computing presents the tantalizing
      possibility that we will be able to construct
      machines capable of solving certain problems
      exponentially faster than any classical
      computer. When quantum computers are built, fields
      ranging from cryptography to physics will be
      profoundly affected. Our group is interested in
      fundamental questions about the interplay between
      computation, cryptography, and quantum
      information. Questions include: how can quantum
      entanglement be used to certify and expand secure
      randomness? What is the complexity of quantum state
      transformations? Which computational problems admit
      a quantum speedup?
    </p>

    <h3>Theory of Distributed Computing</h3>
    <p>
      Our research in the theory of distributed computing
      studies both shared memory and message passing systems. We
      are particularly interested in issues of fault tolerance,
      synchronization, and the limits on the computational power
      of shared memory primitives.
