		<h2>Theoretical Computer Science</h2>
          <p> In the theory of computation area, we use mathematical
            techniques to understand the nature of computation and to
            design and analyze algorithms for important and fundamental
            problems. </p>
          <p> The members of the theory group are all interested, in
            one way or another, in the limitations of computation:
            What problems are not feasible to solve on a computer? How
            can the infeasibility of a problem be used to rigorously
            construct secure cryptographic protocols? What problems
            cannot be solved faster using more machines? What are the
            limits to how fast a particular problem can be solved or
            how much space is needed to solve it? How do randomness,
            parallelism, the operations that are allowed, and the need
            for fault tolerance or security affect this?  Here are
            some of the research areas of current interest: </p>

	  <h3>Algorithmic Game Theory/Mechanism Design</h3>
          <p>
          Game theory and mechanism design study processes in which self
          interested agents participate so as to maximize their desired
          utility (e.g. their value for items obtained minus the price
          paid for those items). Such self-interested behaviour may not
          align with more global objectives (e.g. the revenue of the
          seller or the total valuation of all items allocated). Game
          theory and mechanism design are well established fields within
          Economics. More recently, algorithmic considerations have
          shown that many of the beautiful results within this
          established field have to be re-thought due to computational
          limitations. </p>
          <h3>Algorithms</h3>
          <p>
          Algorithm design and analysis is an essential aspect of
          every area of computer science. Over the past decade, the
          <i>big data</i> phenomenon has brought into sharp focus the
          design of fast algorithms. Our group focuses on the the
          design of efficient (optimal or approximation) algorithms
          for classic TCS problems such as maximum flow, and for novel
          problems arising from machine learning, statistics, and
          differential privacy. Such algorithm design brings together
          techniques from a huge number of diverse areas such as
          combinatorics, high-dimensional geometry, continuous
          optimization, approximation theory, etc.
	  <h3>Complexity Theory</h3>
          <p> There is great beauty in theoretical computer science. It
            is exciting to discover what makes a particular problem
            difficult, to find a provably optimal solution to a problem,
            or to discover unexpected connections between seemingly
            unrelated problems. Theoretical computer science provides
            important new ways of thinking about computation and
            provides lasting insights that are applicable to a wide
            variety of systems. There are also great challenges and
            opportunities since so many basic problems remain unsolved.
          </p>
          <!--<h3>Proof Complexity</h3>-->
          <h3>Cryptography and Differential Privacy</h3>
          <p>
          Traditionally, cryptography concerned the question of how two
          people who share a key can securely communicate over an
          insecure channel. This question is related to the existence of
          pseudo-random generators and one-way functions, and involves
          deep open questions in computational complexity. Public-key
          encryption and signatures allow us to do even more things.
          Recently, we have considered fine-grained questions about ways
          in which information can remain secret, leading to
          applications such as secure and efficient computing using an
          insecure "cloud".
          </p>

	  <p>
	    Differential privacy is an area of research which
	    formalizes private data analysis, analogously to how
	    cryptography formalizes secure communication. Machine
	    learning and statistics are increasingly applied to data
	    sets which contain sensitive information about people. A
	    slew of attacks has shown that it is possible to link
	    seemingly aggregate statistics of such data sets with
	    publicly available data and reveal private information
	    about specific individuals. The central goal of
	    differential privacy is to design algorithms that 
	    make such attacks provably impossible while extracting
	    useful aggregate information from the data. Our focus is
	    on designing efficient differentially private algorithms
	    for problems in statistics and machine learning, and to
	    understand the inherent limitations of private data
	    analysis.

	  <!-- common combinatorial search and -->
          <!-- optimization problems. -->
	  <!-- One aspect of our work is -->
          <!-- to model basic algorithmic paradigms (e.g. greedy -->
          <!-- algorithms, local search, dynamic programming, primal-dual -->
          <!-- algorithms) so as to understand the power and limitations of -->
          <!-- such algorithmic paradigms. -->
          </p>

          <h3>Discrete Mathematics</h3>
          <p> Discrete Mathematics involves the study of the
            properties, algorithms and applications of mathematical
            structures built on discrete objects. There is a rich interplay
             between theoretical computer science and
            discrete mathematics: structural results about discrete
            objects often underlie algorithmic advances, while an
            algorithmic viewpoint can lead to a deeper understanding
            of the mathematics. Our group is primarily concerned with
            the mathematical and algorithmic issues pertaining to
            Graph Theory and Discrepancy Theory.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Discrepancy Theory</h3>
	  <p>
            Discrepancy theory studies how well discrete objects can
            approximate continuous ones: how uniform can a set of n
            points in the plane be? How balanced can a hypergraph
            coloring be? Such questions have many connections to
            computer science, from proving data structure lower
            bounds, to designing efficient approximation
            algorithms. Our group is interested in these connections,
            and in algorithmic problems in discrepancy theory.
	  </p>

          <h3>Graph Theory</h3>
          <p> A graph consists of V (a set of vertices) and E (a set of
            edges, either ordered or unordered, joining pairs of
            vertices in V). It is clear that any binary relation may be
            modeled as a graph; thus, applications of graphs pervade
            computer science. The interests of our group include
            computational biology, random structures and the structure
            of electrical circuits, as well as more traditional graph
            theory such as graph colouring, perfect graphs,
            hamiltonicity and generalizations of graphs. </p>
          <!-- <h3>Combinatorial Designs</h3> -->
          <!-- <p> A combinatorial design is a collection of sets satisfying -->
          <!--   some given regularity properties of its subsets. The -->
          <!--   structures can be as loose as regular graphs or as tight as -->
          <!--   finite projective geometries. The fundamental problems of -->
          <!--   design theory are the existence, enumeration and generation -->
          <!--   of designs with given parameters. Applications of designs -->
          <!--   are found in statistics (the design of experiments), -->
          <!--   error-correcting codes, computer architecture and -->
          <!--   cryptography. Our group's interests include the development -->
          <!--   and analysis of deterministic and randomized combinatorial -->
          <!--   search techniques, algebraic methods for the construction of -->
          <!--   solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, sub-object -->
          <!--   and/or automorphism-free systems, systems containing -->
          <!--   specified small partial systems and design invariants. </p> -->

	  <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
	        <p>Quantum computing presents the tantalizing
		  possibility that we will be able to construct
		  machines capable of solving certain problems
		  exponentially faster than any classical
		  computer. When quantum computers are built, fields
		  ranging from cryptography to physics will be
		  profoundly affected. Our group is interested in
		  fundamental questions about the interplay between
		  computation, cryptography, and quantum
		  information. Questions include: how can quantum
		  entanglement be used to certify and expand secure
		  randomness? What is the complexity of quantum state
		  transformations? Which computational problems admit
		  a quantum speedup?</p>

          <h3>Theory of Distributed Computing</h3>
          <p> Our research in the theory of distributed computing
            studies both shared memory and message passing systems. We
            are particularly interested in issues of fault tolerance,
            synchronization, and the limits on the computational power
            of shared memory primitives. </p>
