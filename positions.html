    <h2>Graduate studies</h2>
    <p>
      The University of Toronto is an exciting place to pursue
      graduate studies in theoretical computer science. Students
      interested in joining the Theory Group should apply
      through <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective" 
      target="_blank">the Department of Computer Science website</a>,
      and indicate that they are interested in pursuing theory.
    </p>

    <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Theoretical Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
      We are currently accepting applications for postdoctoral
      positions, starting in the academic year 2025-2026. The
      positions are typically for two years. We will be considering
      candidates from all areas of theoretical computer science,
      including algorithms, complexity theory, cryptography,
      differential privacy, distributed computing, graph theory,
      quantum computing, and theoretical aspects of machine learning.
      Candidates must possess a PhD prior to starting and give
      evidence of an outstanding research record and potential.
    </p>

    <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Algorithms and Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Prof. Sushant Sachdeva is also accepting applications for a
      postdoctoral position beginning in Fall 2025. Successful
      candidates will work with him on topics including (but not
      limited to): design of fast algorithms, optimization, and
      mathematicl machine learning. Candidates must possess a PhD
      prior to starting and give evidence of an outstanding research
      record and potential. If you would like to apply specifically to
      this position, please cc Prof. Sushant Sachdeva at sachdeva [at]
      cs.toronto.edu when submitting your application as per
      instructions below.</p>
	
    <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Algorithmic Fairness and Value-Alignment Using Social Choice Theory</h2>
    <p>Prof. Nisarg Shah is also accepting applications for a postdoctoral position beginning in Summer or Fall 2025. Successful candidate(s) will work with him on topics such as (but not limited to): algorithmic fairness (in voting, resource allocation, matching, and machine learning), pluralistic value-alignment in RLHF, cooperative AI, and AI safety. The position is guaranteed for one year with the possibility of an extension for another year. Applicants should have (prior to starting) a PhD in computer science, economics, operations research, or a related field. If you would like to apply specifically to this position, please cc Prof. Nisarg Shah at nisarg [at] cs.toronto.edu when submitting your application as per the instructions below.</p>
  
    <p>
      <h2> Applying to postdoctoral positions. </h2> Applications should
      be sent to the Theory Group Committee
      at <a href="mailto:postdocapp@cs.toronto.edu">postdocapp@cs.toronto.edu</a>. The
      application should include a CV, a Research Statement, and three
      letters of recommendation. You may also attach a cover letter
      with any additional information you believe is relevant. For
      full consideration, all materials, including the letters of
      recommendation, should be received
      by <strong><font color="red">December 15,
      2024</font></strong>. (Late applications will be reviewed if the position is not yet filled.)
