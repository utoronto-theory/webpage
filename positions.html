    <h2>Graduate studies</h2>
    <p>
      The University of Toronto is an exciting place to pursue
      graduate studies in theoretical computer science. Students
      interested in joining the Theory Group should apply
      through <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective" 
      target="_blank">the Department of Computer Science website</a>,
      and indicate that they are interested in pursuing theory.
    </p>

    <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Theoretical Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
      The theory group at the Department of Computer Science, University 
      of Toronto, anticipates up to two postdoctoral positions beginning 
      in Fall 2023 and is accepting applications for the 2023-2024 academic 
      year. The positions are typically for two years. We are seeking candidates
      from all areas of theoretical computer science including algorithms, 
      complexity theory, cryptography, differential privacy, distributed computing,
      graph theory, quantum computing, and theoretical aspects of machine learning.
      Candidates must possess a PhD prior to starting and give evidence of an 
      outstanding research record and potential.
    </p>

    <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Algorithms and Theoretical Machine Learning</h2>     
    <p>
      Prof. Sushant Sachdeva is also accepting applications
      for a postdoctoral position beginning in Fall
      2023. Successful candidates will work with him on topics
      including (but not limited to): design of fast
      algorithms, optimization, and theoretical machine
      learning. Candidates must possess a PhD prior to
      starting and give evidence of an outstanding research
      record and potential.
    </p>

<!-- <h2>Postdoctoral position in Computational Social Choice</h2> -->
      <!--  <p>Prof. Nisarg Shah is also accepting applications for up to two additional postdoctoral positions beginning in Fall 2020. Successful candidate(s) will work with him on topics such as (but not limited to): computational social choice, fairness and incentives in machine learning, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design. The positions are for up to two years. Applicants should have (prior to starting) a PhD in computer science, economics, operations research, or a related field.</p> -->

    <h2>Applying to postdoctoral positions</h2>
    <p>
      Applicants should email their CV and
      research statement to Theory Group Committee
      (<a href="mailto:postdocapp@cs.toronto.edu">postdocapp@cs.toronto.edu</a>),
      and indicate which positions they would like
      to be considered for. They should also arrange
      for at least three letters of recommendation
      to be sent to the same email address. For full
      consideration, all materials, including the
      letters of recommendation, should be received
      by <strong><font color="red">December 15,
      2022</font></strong>. (Late applications might
      not receive full consideration.)
