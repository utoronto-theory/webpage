	  <h2>Graduate studies</h2>

	  <p>
	    The University of Toronto is an exciting place to pursue
	    graduate studies in theoretical computer science. Students
	    interested in joining the Theory Group should apply
	    through <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective" 
	    target="_blank">the Department of Computer Science website</a>,
	    and indicate that they are interested in pursuing theory.
	  </p>

          <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Theoretical Computer
            Science</h2>
            <p>The theory group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, anticipates up to two postdoctoral positions beginning in Fall 2023 and is accepting applications for the 2023-2024 academic year. The positions are typically for two years. We are seeking candidates from all areas of theoretical computer science including algorithms, complexity theory, cryptography, differential privacy, distributed computing, graph theory, quantum computing, and theoretical aspects of machine learning. Candidates must possess a PhD prior to starting and give evidence of an outstanding research record and potential.</p>

	              <h2>Postdoctoral positions in Algorithms and
            Theoretical Machine Learning</h2>
            
            <p>Prof. Sushant Sachdeva is also accepting applications
	      for a postdoctoral position beginning in Fall
	      2023. Successful candidates will work with him on topics
	      including (but not limited to): design of fast
	      algorithms, optimization, and theoretical machine
	      learning. Candidates must possess a PhD prior to
	      starting and give evidence of an outstanding research
	      record and potential.</p>

<!-- <h2>Postdoctoral position in Computational Social Choice</h2> -->
		  <!-- 	<p>Prof. Nisarg Shah is also accepting applications for up to two additional postdoctoral positions beginning in Fall 2020. Successful candidate(s) will work with him on topics such as (but not limited to): computational social choice, fairness and incentives in machine learning, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design. The positions are for up to two years. Applicants should have (prior to starting) a PhD in computer science, economics, operations research, or a related field.</p> -->

		  <h2>Applying to postdoctoral positions</h2>
			
			<p>Applicants should email their CV and
			research statement to Theory Group Committee
			(<a href="mailto:postdocapp@cs.toronto.edu">postdocapp@cs.toronto.edu</a>),
			and indicate which positions they would like
			to be considered for. They should also arrange
			for at least three letters of recommendation
			to be sent to the same email address. For full
			consideration, all materials, including the
			letters of recommendation, should be received
			by <strong><font color="red">December 15,
			2022</font></strong>. (Late applications might
			not receive full consideration.)</p>
